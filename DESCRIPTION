Description: A common problem faced by journal reviewers and authors is the question of
     whether the results of a replication study are consistent with the original
     published study. One solution to this problem is to examine the effect size
     from the original study and generate the range of effect sizes that could
     reasonably be obtained (due to random sampling) in a replication attempt
     (i.e., calculate a replication interval). If a replication effect size falls
     outside the replication interval, then that effect likely did not occur
     due to the effects of sampling error alone. Alternatively, if a replication
     effect size falls within the replication interval, then the replication
     effect could have reasonably occurred due to the effects of sampling error
     alone. This package has functions that calculate the replication interval for 
     the correlation (i.e., r), standardized mean difference (i.e., d-value), and mean. 
     The calculations used in version 2.0.0 and onward differ from past calculations 
     due to feedback during the journal review process. The new calculations allow 
     for a more precise interpretation of the replication interval.
